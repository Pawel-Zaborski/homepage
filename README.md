# AI Webpage
This simple webpage treats about the AI technology and its brief history. It has been made as one of the first homeworks for the “Frontend Developer” course https://youcode.pl
## Demo
https://pawel-zaborski.github.io/homepage/
## Technology used
Apart from the standard/simple HTML, CSS and Java Script for the first time I have used normalize.css and Google Fonts as well as very simple Java Script functions in the separate blocks indicated by square brackets.
## Manual
Straightforward webpage layout and simple nav menu allows an intuitive usage of the webpage and overall navigation.
